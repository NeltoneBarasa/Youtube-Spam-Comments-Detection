# Youtube-Spam-Comments-Detection

## Overview  
This project focuses on detecting spam comments on YouTube using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of YouTube comments labeled as spam or non-spam, which are preprocessed for analysis. Various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization, are applied to clean and transform the text data. The primary objective is to build an effective classification model to automate spam detection, improving the quality of online discussions.  

## Model and Training  
Several machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, are trained to classify spam and non-spam comments. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are used to convert text into numerical features for model training. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are employed to optimize model accuracy and reduce overfitting.  

## Evaluation and Results  
The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is generated to analyze false positives and false negatives in spam detection. The best-performing model is selected based on its ability to balance precision and recall, minimizing both false alarms and missed spam messages. This project serves as a foundation for deploying automated spam detection systems on YouTube or other social media platforms, enhancing user experience by filtering out unwanted content.
